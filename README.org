* GO OpenSearch
  A self-contained OpenSearch broker and suggests server using BBOP JS
  and the GOlr backend. Designed to integrate with AmiGO 2.

  It may be deployed on OpenShift, Heroku, or run locally. The
  response times seem to be just slow enough when deployed on
  OpenShift or Heroku the the easier/smaller responses are dropped by
  the time they come back (no display).

  The public (non-deployment) repo is at:
