* GO OpenSearch

  A self-contained OpenSearch server using BBOP JS and the GOlr
  backed. Designed to integrate with AmiGO 2. Deployed on OpenShift.

  The response times seem to be just slow enough when deployed on
  OpenShift the the easier/smaller responses are dropped by the time
  they come back (no display)

  The public (non-deployment) repo is at:
  https://github.com/kltm/go-opensearch
** Testing
   node server.js
** Deployment
   push to OpenShift
